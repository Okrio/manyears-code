The ManyEars project was setup to provide source code for AUDIBLE project. It 
provides FlowDesigner building-blocks for microphone array processing. This 
includes sound source localisation, tracking and separation.

Description of the algorithms
=============================

The algorithms included in this software are described in the following papers:
* J.-M. Valin, S. Yamamoto, J. Rouat, F. Michaud, K. Nakadai, H.G. Okuno, "Robust Recognition of Simultaneous Speech By a Mobile Robot", To appear in IEEE Transactions on Robotics.
* J.-M. Valin, F. Michaud, J. Rouat, Robust Localization and Tracking of Simultaneous Moving Sound Sources Using Beamforming and Particle Filtering. Robotics and Autonomous Systems Journal (Elsevier), Vol. 55, No. 3, pp. 216-228, 2007.

Installing and Running ManyEars project
======================================

Hardware configuration
======================

Recommended hardware:
- HDSP RME PCMCIA card
- Multiface box
- Connexion cable between the card 
- Electrical Power adapter
- 
- 8 microphones and 8 cables
- 1 microphone interface card
- 1 cable to connect the interface card to the Multiface (DB-9 to 8 jack 1/4)
- Power cable splitter

* NOTE any other 8-channel soundcard can be used (e.g. M-Audio Delta 1010LT).

RME Driver
----------

The driver for the RME is directly in the kernel (suggest a least kernel 2.6.8)

A firmware must be loaded in card at the initialisation. The firmware is
contained in the alsa-firmware package, which is available at the alsa-project
website. The firmware also need a specific loader which is in the alsa-tool
package, in the hdsploader directory, also available from the alsa project. 
These two must be compiled.
(The usual "configure; make; make install" works and the files will be 
installed in the /usr/local prefix.)


Software installation
=====================

Dependencies
------------

- fftw3 (fftw3f library for floating point)
- FlowDesigner

Usefull tools
-------------
flac
sox
audacity

Compiling the FlowDesigner toolbox
----------------------------------

1) Generate Makefiles with CMake

cmake .

2) Compile & Install 

make;make install

You might want to change the default prefix. This is located in CMakeLists.txt. The variable name is FD_PREFIX.

You should also make sure your architecture is properly set in src/CMakeLists.txt

Edit this line to fit your setup :

SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-msse -O3")

parameters:

Note: replace -msse by -march=<architecture> for better performances.

Tools
-----

To adust the input volume, the package alsa-tool contains the software
hsdpmixer. This install instruction are the same as hdsploader. It depends
on libfltk1.1-dev.


Running the software
====================

Raw file example:
./separation_spl_coque.n my_raw_file some_base_name robot_mic_pos.mat

where my_raw_file needs to be a raw file, 16-bit/sample (machine endianness),
8 channels, 48 kHz sampling rate. robot_mic_pos.mat contains the position of
microphones in 3D, with (x, y, z) coordinates. The z axis needs to be the
vertical and points downwards (the others are arbitrary).

FLAC file:
flac --force-raw-format --endian=little --sign=signed -cd fichier_audio.flac | ./separation_spl_coque.n /dev/stdin robot_mic_pos.mat

The position of all sources is printer on stdout with these (main) fields:
<time> <source ID> <x pos> <y pos> <z pos>
(x y and z are normalized to have a length of 1)
