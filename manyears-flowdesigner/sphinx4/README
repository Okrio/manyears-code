* INFO

Sphinx4TcpServer is a simple Sphinx4 server that 
receives an audio TCP stream and detects 
digits (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). You can use 4 instances 
of this server to receive the separated audio streams 
from ManyEars. Use "LocalizeSeparAndSaveTCP.n" in the 
FlowDesigner examples of ManyEars.

You can test the server with a WAV with the "SendWavOverTcp.n" 
example in the FlowDesigner directory and use the wav 
"10001-90210-01803.wav" provided.

For an advanced speech detection (detecting more words, 
sentence...), refer to to Sphinx4 documentation.
